## Demo

This [:tv: short video (< 4 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpjQTGKm-ok)  goes over key concepts of creating workflows in pong.

## Available integrations

pong has 200+ different nodes to automate workflows. A full list can be found at [https://github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness).

## Documentation

The official pong documentation can be found at [https://github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness).

Additional information and example workflows are available on the website at [https://github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness).

## Start pong in Docker

In the terminal, enter the following:

```bash
docker volume create pong_data

docker run -it --rm \
 --name pong \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -v pong_data:/home/node/.pong \
 docker.github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness/pongio/pong
```

This command will download the required pong image and start your container.
You can then access pong by opening:
[http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, `pong_data`. The workflow data gets saved in an SQLite database in the user folder (`/home/node/.pong`). This folder also contains important data like the webhook URL and the encryption key used for securing credentials.

If this data can't be found at startup pong automatically creates a new key and any existing credentials can no longer be decrypted.

## Use with PostgreSQL

By default, pong uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions and workflows. However, pong also supports using PostgreSQL.

> **WARNING**: Even when using a different database, it is still important to
persist the `/home/node/.pong` folder, which also contains essential pong
user data including the encryption key for the credentials.

In the following commands, replace the placeholders (depicted within angled brackets, e.g. `<POSTGRES_USER>`) with the actual data:

```bash
docker volume create pong_data

docker run -it --rm \
 --name pong \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \
 -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \
 -v pong_data:/home/node/.pong \
 docker.github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness/pongio/pong
```

A full working setup with docker-compose can be found [here](https://github.com/pong-io/pong-hosting/blob/main/docker-compose/withPostgres/README.md).

## Passing sensitive data using files

To avoid passing sensitive information via environment variables, "\_FILE" may be appended to some environment variable names. pong will then load the data from a file with the given name. This makes it possible to load data easily from Docker and Kubernetes secrets.

The following environment variables support file input:

- DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_USER_FILE
- DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA_FILE

## Example server setups

Example server setups for a range of cloud providers and scenarios can be found in the [Server Setup documentation](https://github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness).

## Updating

Before you upgrade to the latest version make sure to check here if there are any breaking changes which may affect you: [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/pong-io/pong/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)

From your Docker Desktop, navigate to the Images tab and select Pull from the context menu to download the latest pong image.

You can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:

### Pull latest (stable) version

```bash
docker pull docker.github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness/pongio/pong
```

### Pull specific version

```bash
docker pull docker.github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness/pongio/pong:0.220.1
```

### Pull next (unstable) version

```bash
docker pull docker.github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness/pongio/pong:next
```

### About `-pc` tags

Tags with a `-pc` suffix (for example `pongio/pong:2.36.0-pc`) are a pointer-compressed variant, internal to pong Cloud. They carry no support or stability guarantees and can change or disappear without notice. Use the regular tags instead.

### About `-debian` tags

Tags with a `-debian` suffix (for example `pongio/pong:2.41.0-debian`) use Debian (glibc) instead of Alpine (musl). Use them only to add a vendor library that needs glibc, for example Oracle Instant Client for Thick mode or the IBM Db2 driver (`ibm_db`). Use the regular tags otherwise.

**The `-debian` tags are a preview.** They can change without notice, and they report more unfixed OS vulnerabilities than the regular tags.

Like the regular image, this image has no package manager, so `RUN apt-get install` does not work in a derived image. Build the library in a stage that has one, then copy it in:

1. Start a build stage from an image with `apt` and the same Debian release: `debian:trixie-slim`, or `node:26-trixie` if the library is a Node native addon that you must compile.
2. Install or download the library in that stage.
3. `COPY --from` the files into `pongio/pong:<version>-debian`. Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `NODE_PATH` if the library needs it.

This example adds Oracle Instant Client:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:trixie-slim AS oracle
ARG TARGETARCH
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates curl unzip && \
    case "$TARGETARCH" in \
      amd64) zip=instantclient-basiclite-linuxx64.zip ;; \
      arm64) zip=instantclient-basiclite-linux-arm64.zip ;; \
    esac && \
    curl -fsSL -o /tmp/ic.zip "https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/$zip" && \
    unzip -q /tmp/ic.zip -d /opt/oracle && mv /opt/oracle/instantclient_* /opt/oracle/instantclient

FROM pongio/pong:2.41.0-debian
COPY --from=oracle /opt/oracle/instantclient /opt/oracle/instantclient
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient
```

**Use the same image in every pong container.** If a deployment has more than one pong container, for example in queue mode or multi-main mode, all containers must use the same image. Do not mix Alpine and Debian images, regular and derived images, or different pong versions. pong does not support a deployment with mixed images.

Stop the container and start it again:

1. Get the container ID:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

2. Stop the container with ID container_id:

```bash
docker stop [container_id]
```

3. Remove the container (this does not remove your user data) with ID container_id:

```bash
docker rm [container_id]
```

4. Start the new container:

```bash
docker run --name=[container_name] [options] -d docker.github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness/pongio/pong
```

### Updating with Docker Compose

If you run pong using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update pong:

```bash
# Pull latest version
docker compose pull

# Stop and remove older version
docker compose down

# Start the container
docker compose up -d
```

## Setting the timezone

To specify the timezone pong should use, the environment variable `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` can
be set. One example where this variable has an effect is the Schedule node.

The system's timezone can be set separately with the environment variable `TZ`.
This controls the output of certain scripts and commands such as `$ date`.

For example, to use the same timezone for both:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
 --name pong \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE="Europe/Berlin" \
 -e TZ="Europe/Berlin" \
 docker.github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness/pongio/pong
```

For more information on configuration and environment variables, please see the [pong documentation](https://github.com/NJHTR/seekwd-studio-pong-studio-pong-harness).


Here's the refined version with good Markdown formatting, ready for your `README`:

## Build Docker Image

**Important Note for Releases 1.101.0 and Later:**
Building the pong Docker image now requires a pre-compiled pong application.

### Recommended Build Process:

For the simplest approach that handles both pong compilation and Docker image creation, run from the root directory:

```bash
pnpm build:docker
```

### Alternative Builders:

If you are using a different build system that requires a separate build context, first compile the pong application:

```bash
pnpm run build:deploy
```

Then, ensure your builder's context includes the `compiled` directory generated by this command.


## What does pong mean and how do you pronounce it?

**Short answer:** It means "nodemation" and it is pronounced as n-eight-n.

**Long answer:** I get that question quite often (more often than I expected) so I decided it is probably best to answer it here. While looking for a good name for the project with a free domain I realized very quickly that all the good ones I could think of were already taken. So, in the end, I chose nodemation. "node-" in the sense that it uses a Node-View and that it uses Node.js and "-mation" for "automation" which is what the project is supposed to help with.
However, I did not like how long the name was and I could not imagine writing something that long every time in the CLI. That is when I then ended up on "pong". Sure it does not work perfectly but neither does it for Kubernetes (k8s) and I did not hear anybody complain there. So I guess it should be ok.
